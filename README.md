# Rent A Car Application - N-Layered Architecture with .NET

This repository is a snapshot created for documentation and knowledge-sharing purposes, capturing the content of a technical training delivered for a specific audience. The training focused on building robust and maintainable applications using N-layered architecture principles in .NET.

## Main Covered Topics

- **N-Layered Architecture:** Separation of concerns into Domain, Application, Persistence, Infrastructure, and WebAPI layers.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles:** Structuring the domain layer with entities and enums.
- **Data Access with Entity Framework Core:** Implementing data persistence, migrations, and the Repository Pattern.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Implementing common application functionalities such as Authentication (JWT, Refresh Tokens, OTP, Email Authenticators), Authorization, Caching, Logging, Transaction Management, and Validation using MediatR pipelines.
- **API Development:** Building RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core Web API.
- **Practical Example:** Developing a "Rent a Car" application demonstrating CRUD operations for core entities (Brands, Models, Cars) and user authentication/authorization.
- **Technologies Used:** .NET, C#, Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core Web API, MediatR.
